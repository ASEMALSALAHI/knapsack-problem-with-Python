This code uses the "bottom-up" or "tabulation" approach in dynamic programming to solve the knapsack problem. In the bottom-up approach, the optimal solution is calculated iteratively, starting from smaller subproblems and building towards larger subproblems. In this code, the preference list is initialized to store the optimal values for each subproblem and the values are then populated using nested loops. This is a common way to implement the bottom-up approach in dynamic programming.
